                        <p style="text-align: left;">A reference group is a group which an individual or another group compares themselves to, thus the name reference. These groups are able to shape how an individual acts since one would want to mirror how these reference groups behave. These groups usually contain higher levels of values and attributes that people find as amazing and something worth following for.</p>

                        <ul style="text-align: left;">

                            <li> Police officers contain certain levels of values and behaviors that many groups, such as the members of CAT and ROTC, would want to live up to. These values include strength, courage, loyalty and many more.</li>
                            <li> Groups tend to compare themselves to the members of the PNP in terms of certain attributes and characteristics and will change the way they behave to mirror these.</li>
                            <li>People may also seek affirmation from police officers to see if they are on the right track to becoming just like a police officer and will typically work harder if they don’t receive this affirmation. </li>
                        
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Leadership</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Considering that we have a democratic government, it would be the goal for the police force to prioritize the welfare of its members over its goals. They still work towards a goal but should the case arise where they were to choose between the lives of the police officers and their goal, they will choose their officers’ lives without hesitation. They use a mix of both instrumental and expressive leadership, but they prioritize expressive leadership over instrumental since the lives of each police officer and their bonds with each other are essential to them. The chief of police would not be able to lead and control his officers if he/she does not have the respect and loyalty from his people, which is more likely achieved through expressive leadership. Despite all of this, the sad reality is that in some areas where corruption is prevalent, instrumental leadership is used. Some police leaders may not care about the welfare of their officers and only care about their goals. Keep in mind that these goals may not even be for the benefit of the community but only for themselves.  </p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Group Think</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">No, the PNP does not enforce group think within the group. This is because their job is to protect society and their respective communities, so should these decisions be immoral, illogical or non-beneficial to the community, they would not consider this decision at all. Even if they were to agree on a certain act as a majority, if this act were to be harmful to the citizens of their community, there is no question this agreed act would be thrown away. The interests and welfare of the citizens are the priority to them so whatever is immoral should not be followed. Yet, this is never an assurance since one little corrupted act or leader can change this whole belief system. </p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Organizational Model</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The PNP have a bureaucratic organizational model due to the fact that they abide by written rules and regulations, which is the Philippine constitution in order to work towards the greater welfare of the Filipino citizens. In addition to this, there are authorities in their hierarchy such as the police captains and deputy chiefs. These authorities are the ones in charge of overseeing the organizations and making sure they adhere and conform to the constitution and the law. Should the PNP be disbanded, these authorities would also lose the power they hold since this power is binded to the existence of the organization. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">A project the PNP has enacted to help is by making checkpoints around the community to ensure that the citizens are following the lockdown restrictions. These checkpoints make sneaking out harder to do, thus preventing the spread of the disease due to unnecessary actions by deviating citizens. If we want the virus to go away, we need to lessen our exposure with each other, especially with the affected. This way, the PNP are helping us discipline and prevent ourselves from leaving our homes for unnecessary and unqualified reasons. </p>
