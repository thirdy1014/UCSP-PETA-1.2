                        <p style="text-align: left;">A primary group is a group where an individual has personal relations with the other members of the group. These relationships and interactions are usually informal, intimate or holistic and are relatively long-lasting or permanent. Due to this, individuals tend to learn the majority of their knowledge and socializing capabilities from their primary group. Their personal identity is formed by the ideals and experiences he/she has had as a member of that primary group. Common examples of an individual's primary group are his/her family, close friends and, in some cases, the church.</p>

                            <li>The relationship of each individual to each other is the strongest that each individual has among all their social relationships. </li>
                            <li>Members of the group typically interact with each other in an informal and intimate manner, although they still formally talk to each should the situation arise.</li>
                            <li>Their relationships with each other have lasted ever since they met one another or at birth of the children.</li>
                            <li>Almost all of the primary knowledge of the children have been learned from this family, including their social and communication skills.</li>
                            <li>The group is not too big that the relationship of certain members with other members may end up worse due to the lack of interaction, it is just the right small size.</li>
                            <li>The members share a similar background and manner of being raised.</li>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The type of leadership the Go family has is an expressive type of leadership. This is, mainly, because they do their best to promote the improvement of each one’s relationship with each other. All the actions and decisions made by the parents are done out of love for their children whether this be directly or indirectly. The parents also make sure to find time to talk to their children and ensure everything is going smoothly in the child’s life. They listen to their children’s opinions and do everything they can to develop this profound relationship that they have built for years. A family’s job is to support each other in all their endeavors and goals, and this is most evident in the actions of the parents towards their children. In order for them to support their children as they mature they must work towards improving their relationship with the child while working together with their child to accomplish the child’s aspirations. </p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Group Think</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The group does sometimes tend to apply group-think especially in regards to superstitions believed by the family’s culture and majority of the family members. Some of these superstitions and beliefs may be illogical to other groups and cultures of people. Group think is also often applied towards their decisions as a family because relationships are important within this group. They often do things that may seem good to do in the present but are illogical actions to follow in the future, despite knowing the negative consequences. This may be seen when the family impulsively goes on vacations despite knowing its unnecessariness and ramifications towards the financial status of the family, just to see the members of the family happy and enjoying themselves for a moment. On the bright side, this only happens on very few occasions, since the family does strongly discipline themselves regarding the welfare of the family. If they see that what the majority of the family wishes to have is harmful and irrational for the future of the family, then they won’t go through with it. In short, should their desires get the best of them, then group-think may happen within the family, but this is never usually the case. </p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Organizational Model</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The group follows a bureaucratic organizational model since, although they like to look at each other in the family as equals, there is still a sense of authority held by the elders or parents. Whether the rules of the family are written or not, parents and elders are there to supervise the actions of the younger ones to make sure they grow up to be mature and respectful adults. They serve as the authoritative figures in the family, such as how fathers are regarded as the leaders or head in the family in patriarchal families or mothers in matriarchal families. The parents of the Go family are the authorities of the children, who influence and oversee the actions of their children to ensure they are living their lives according to the norms.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The Go family was very proactive when it came to the availability of vaccinations in our country. Before the news even got out that the Philippines was able to secure covid-19 vaccines, the family had already found a way to try and procure moderna vaccines privately together with other family friends. Although this didn’t work out because the Pfizer vaccines arrived in the Philippines first before the ordered moderna vaccines. In addition to this, they were also very attentive and aware of when vaccines were already being distributed and available for the public. As of now, it is only the youngest of the family who has not yet been vaccinated, but is already in the process of being so. Furthermore, they have also rarely been leaving the house and only do so if the situation is very necessary such as groceries, although they have now been relying on online deliveries. Outside contact has been kept close to zero, especially for the children.</p>
