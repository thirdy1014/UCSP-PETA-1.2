                        <p style="text-align: left;">Compared to primary groups, secondary groups are usually larger in size. The interactions between members are usually more formal because the relationships between one another have not yet been developed that much. These groups are usually held together by goals unlike the personal bonds that are present in primary groups. Due to this, interactions between individuals of the group are short and less in number. Relationships in the group are also usually temporary because what binds the members together are goals and should a goal be completed, they need not keep in touch or maintain a relationship with each other anymore. Members tend to know little to nothing about the emotional and personal life of one another, holding no significance to the lives of each other. In a way, you can say that secondary groups are the opposite of primary groups.</p>

                        <ul style="text-align: left;">

                            <li>Members of the organization are not united by personal relationships but by a goal or their vision mission which is to reduce poverty and promote social progress.</li>
                            <li>Relationships in the group are temporary since these would eventually end if one leaves the organization or if the organization were to get disbanded.</li>
                            <li>Interactions between members are usually formal since they don’t know each other that well, due to the lack of interactions between them.</li>
                            <li>When members interact with each other, their conversation would usually be related to their goal at hand instead of something personal about the other. </li>
                            <li>The relationships of each member with the other are not that significant compared to an individual’s relationship with family and friends.</li>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Considering that they work towards social progress, the type of leadership that the organization has would be an expressive form of leadership. Making sure they work towards a goal and at the same time working towards the unity and coherence of the group. Project ideas submitted by members will also be considered or taken into account instead of just enacting whatever the higher ups want to employ. They prioritize their relationships with its volunteers to increase their chemistry as an organization and to improve group chemistry and efficiency during projects.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Group think would not be something that is typically employed in this organization since they work towards alleviating poverty. Enacting immoral and illogical acts will just end up harming the vision mission of the organization, despite the agreement of the majority of its members. These acts would not promote business sector leadership and commitment to programs, which is a main theme in their mission, but instead group-think may corrupt their way of thinking and influence the people they sought to help in the same negative way. Since they are tied to moral obligations through their vision mission, going through with immoral group-think acts that have been voted by majority would not likely happen. </p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The organization has a bureaucratic organizational model because they follow a written set of rules which is their vision mission. These rules may also include organizational bylaws which each member should understand before becoming a part of the organization. Furthermore, they have authorities that ensure the compliance to these written rules. They also handle the final decisions of the organization, such as the employment and validation of certain organization projects. Lastly, it is a bureaucratic organizational model because should the organization be disbanded, these authorities will lose their power as the organization is being taken down.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">PBSP’s projects and efforts to help the citizens of the community face covid-19 were concentrated in 3 certain areas. First we have food distribution, where they distribute packs of food to people of the community worth 750 pesos each. Second, we have healthy safety, where they hand out packs of masks to poor families in urbanized areas susceptible to covid-19 worth around 300 pesos each. Lastly, we have educational continuity, where they give out paper, ink and data load to teachers of schools to help them prepare for other school necessities in teaching.</p>
