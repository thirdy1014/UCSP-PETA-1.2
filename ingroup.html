                        <p style="text-align: left;">An in-group is the group of people where an individual expresses his affiliation and loyalty to. You can say an in-group, from what the name suggests, is a group that an individual is a part of. A group where an individual shares similar characteristics with other members of the group and conforms to the norms held acceptable by the group. </p>

                            <li> SHS - HdJ has their own school logo or symbol to represent their students, faculty and other personnel who are part of their community.</li>
                            <li> Members of the school, both students and personnel, have uniforms that they wear every school day to distinguish themselves from other people or schools. </li>
                            <li>They have titles to identify each other, such as principals, sisters and even president for the student body. In addition to this, each student in SHS-HdJ is known as a hearter. </li>
                            <li>They naturally are called to give positive stereotypes to each other in school whether it be just to greet each other or as congratulatories for achievements, although they do not apply negative stereotypes to people not a part of the school since it isn’t what they are called to do. </li>
                            <li>They also tend to educatively clash with members of out-groups or other schools in many academic and physical fields of competition.</li>
                            <li>Members feel a connection with each other and the community, which makes them willing to do anything for their brothers and sisters in the organization, as they were raised and taught to by the school. </li>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">Considering that they are a religious school, the type of leadership that the school has is an expressive form of leadership. I say this because it would be the goal of a religious school or institution to treat each member with love and compassion which would include working on your relationship with each other. The leaders of the school prioritize and concentrate on improving their relationship with God, their students and fellow school personnel. This is also evident in the leaders of the student body. All the efforts and decisions made by the heads of the student body were made for the betterment of each student’s learning experience. Each of the actions made by the leaders within the school were aimed towards building loving and caring relationships with each other. This may be considered as being goal-oriented but then the goal coincides with maintaining a united and loving community which is what an expressive leader does. </p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Group Think</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">Group-think is not usually applied in the school because they always consider the moral and logical aspects of their decisions. Despite a decision being approved by the majority of its members, such as the students, these are not usually approved because they may be illogical thoughts by students. Any change in decisions must be supported by logic and reason by its members for it to be approved, which means the validation from majority isn’t the only requirement for a decision to be acted out. Any idea that may seem harmful and irrational to its members or even people outside of their community will not be followed or even considered considering that they are a religious institution.</p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Organizational Model</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">The school follows a bureaucratic organizational model because each personnel and student adheres to a set of written rules written in the teacher and student’s handbooks. These rules are then re-oriented to each of the members of the school during their first days of school in order to make sure everyone understands what they are called to do and follow. Considering that there exists a set of rules in the school, it follows that there are authorities in the school who oversee the conformity to these rules. These authorities are present in the form of the school’s principal, sisters and head of decorum. These authorities ensure the compliance of each member to ensure a loving and efficient process when working towards the school’s vision mission. Lastly, they are bureaucratic because should the school be abolished, the powers of each authority will also be abolished with it. Their powers are tied to the establishment and not the individual, itself.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">The school personnel have volunteered on multiple occasions to help in different community pantries in Cebu. Faculty and staff have spent their time supporting and overseeing the smooth and fair flow of community pantries. In addition to this, personnel and some students have made monetary and food donations in order to provide and buy extra goods that can be put to use for the people reliant on the existence of community pantries during the covid-19 pandemic. One specific example is their success in a community pantry located in a mountain barangay in Dumanjug. Being a generous and loving school, they have, without a doubt, had more projects similar to this before and will continue to have projects like this in the future. </p>
